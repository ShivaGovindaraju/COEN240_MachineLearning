Please Note: My own code is found in Assignment1, Program1 and Program2. The Group Project was a collaborative effort.

The remainder of the code in this repository was written Professor David C. Anastasiu who taught the course. The notes are saved here for personal posterity regarding ML coding in Python and other useful techniques.
